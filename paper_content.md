## Introduction

4 parts:

1) Wordy phrases giving reason for work & interest — why read the paper?
2) Brief description of the background to the problem & connection of present work to background
3) Brief description of the background to the problem & connection of present work to background
4) Clear statement of the purpose or goal of the work — lead smoothly into start of paper

According to Stanford CS department:

1) What is the problem?
2) Why is it interesting and important?
3) Why is it hard? (E.g., why do naive approaches fail?)
4) Why hasn't it been solved before? (Or, what's wrong with previous proposed solutions? How does mine differ?)
5) What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations.

### What is the problem

### Why is it interesting and important

Talk about importance of UX and user satisfaction, growth of sites and products, finding the answer to "what are the most optimal layouts" can serve as being beneficial to businesses (financial and social capital), designers looking to optimize their experiences and focus on other parts, and developers to implement MVPs and "tried-and-true" layouts

### Why is it hard (e.g., why do naive approaches fail?)

Web design, layouts, and sub-components contain a great degree of subjectivity, room for improvement, and natural iterative processes. It may be extremely costly in both monetary and time resources to find the most effective layouts or hierarchical structures, and what metrics can be best associated with such. Even with analysis of existing layouts and successful implementations, doing so manually is cost-intensive and provides a less objective analysis of content, with subconscious pejoratives or approbations due to typography, colors, and copy resulting in distraction. In data sets which contain a large number of samples, such as a set of the highest indexed sites on Google (e.g., 10000), identification of both common and more intricate patterns are incredibly difficult to find. In contrast, statistical methods and the use of trained algorithmic models can have high success rates in identifying patterns which may otherwise not be seen. Thus, there is a chance that integrating algorithmic models into site analysis to identify patterns may more significantly benefit the field of software engineering.

### What are the key components of my approach and results? Also include any specific limitations
