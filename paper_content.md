## Introduction

1. Layout & websites: what and how it impacts
Talk about importance of user experience (UX) and user satisfaction, growth of sites and products, finding the answer to "what are the most optimal layouts" can serve as being beneficial to businesses (financial and social capital), designers looking to optimize their experiences and focus on other parts, and developers to implement Minimum Viable Products (MVPs) and "tried-and-true" layouts. User experience has continually developed in the field of software engineering and product development as an influential and integral part of applications. Alongside accessibility and presence of I18n in web interfaces and applications, perceived user experiences—notably design, animation, and usability—are one of the most important aspects to consider in the success of product or application interaction [Supporting user-perceived usability benchmarking through a developed quantitative metric]. In the domain of products or applications, the quality of the respective user experience is a determining factor in user retention, satisfaction, revenues, and other analytical measures used to determine the success of a product. Beyond having objective impact on success and revenue, user experience drives both offline and online interactions that results in both psychological and economic impact on consumers and businesses. As such, user experience in the ever-growing repository of information and access that is the internet has become of significant focus in recent years, with many companies hiring UI and UX researchers alongside data analysts to guide internal product decision-making. With the growth of information on user experience, there are a significant amount of both practical and technical applications being created for user experiences theses and findings. Forward-facing (what the hell does this mean?) products and services are known to successfully utilize effective hierarchical structure and layout design patterns to optimize user experience (UX) and associated metrics. Identification of the easiest to use and most appealing interfaces can allow for businesses and vendors to beat out competition, increasing revenue and attraction of customers to the respective site [The Engangement of Websites]. 

2. Current data, research, & lack thereof; introduce ML fts
While both fields of software engineering and machine learning have individually been addressed and researched, there are very few studies which look at a possible integration of machine learning with software engineering (more specifically, web design) and moreover no definite data on how layouts affect certain UX metrics. Web design, layouts, and sub-components contain a great degree of subjectivity,room for improvement, and natural iterative processes.
Similarly, in recent years, a specialization of artificial intelligence (AI) known as machine learning (ML) has significantly grown in popularity and focus. **COME BACK TO** Applications of machine learning such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), pattern recognition, and image classification establish opportunities for automated image caption and description generation [ShowandTell: ANeuralImageCaptionGenerator], labeling of features and objects [Learning Hierarchical Features for Scene Labeling], and identifying common patterns within a set of images [PatternNet:VisualPatternMiningwithDeepNeuralNetwork]. Of most focus in relation to this study is the capability for pattern recognition and scene labeling using ML and CNNs. In order to identify UX that is most suggestive and associated with success, identifying patterns in the most successful sites could be of benefit and could possibly be best achieved through these algorithms. Though simply identifying patterns will not automatically show what UX is best and why, implementation of components and layouts may lead to discovery. Purpose of this research is to 1) identify the most common site layouts found from the highest-ranking or indexed sites on the web, and 2) identify what user experience metrics can be best associated with what layouts.
Goal of this research is to come away with results and findings that can apply to real-world products and services, or further be extended upon by other researchers and agencies.
 Though UX is clearly expanding as a field and significant area of focus in software engineering, research on this field is relatively limited and restricted to case studies and companies akin to locally scoped data, suggesting a need for more definitive data.

3. RQs

- 1: How do hierarchical layouts impact associated user experience metrics?
- 2: How can features best be implemented to optimize a greater range of these metrics?
  
4. Proposed solutions & takeaway

 In data sets which contain a large number of samples, such as a set of the highest indexed sites on Google (10,000 - 100,000 indices), identification of both common and more intricate patterns are incredibly difficult to find. In contrast, statistical methods and the use of trained algorithmic models can have high success rates in identifying patterns which may otherwise not be seen.
Thus, there is a chance that integrating algorithmic models into site analysis to identify patterns may more significantly benefit the field of software engineering. Because of the aforementioned limitations of manual analysis, layouts and structures which are deemed to be efficient and successful are strictly subjective and reported on "at-will" basis; this information may come from individual analyses or findings by user experience/user interface researchers, and vary rarely from companies themselves due to concerns of proprietary software and competition. Further, from attempting to find academic works on the integration of machine learning or statistical methods into the web/interface subset of software engineering, it became evident that little to no research with this approach has been done. With the especially exponential growth in recent years and changes in design knowledge/metrics/analytics, much of the existing data are relatively dated. As such, a promising approach is to collect existing data from rankings and then utilize machine learning/algorithms to find the desired patterns or data. Utilization of machine learning pattern/object recognition that feeds screenshots of the collection of pages (highest indexed sites) to identify common patterns and layouts.
It may be extremely costly in both monetary and time resources to find the most effective layouts or hierarchical structures, and what metrics can be best associated with such. Even with analysis of existing layouts and successful implementations, doing so manually is cost-intensive and provides a less objective analysis of content, with subconscious pejoratives or approbations due to typography, colors, and copy resulting in distraction.  Despite widespread knowledge of this need for proper user interfaces (UI) and UX, definitive and well-documented records of the most common and effective layouts fail to exist. Little definitive research exists on the most effective and utilized site layouts in addition to possible associations in UX metrics and variables of success. Recent studies/inquiries by designers have brought up the possibility that the "F / Z patterns" that have been studied and observed in previous research may not be as applicable with current products.


Thus, this paper seeks to identify the most **effective** hierarchical structures and patterns seen in highest-indexing sites, and measure which UX metrics can be best associated with a given layout.
