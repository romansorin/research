Find at least 10 Sources that are in your discipline of study.
These do not have to be specifically connected to your topic, but they do need to connect to your discipline (i.e. Science, Social Studies, Math, History, Humanities, etc.)
Places to look: THESE MUST BE PEER REVIEWED
Google Scholar, EBSCO, PubMed, Research Gate, ERIC, JSTOR, etc.

Rationale: These sources will help you see all of the rules of your discipline when writing your academic paper. The hope is that you will learn how to shape your paper from the samples you select.
