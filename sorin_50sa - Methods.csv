Han, B. Hwang and J. Jeon, 'A navigation pattern analysis of university department’s websites using a processing mining approach', Innovations in Education and Teaching International, vol. 52, no. 5, pp. 485-498, 2013. Available: 10.1080/14703297.2013.832634.","Case study resulting from increased complexity and growth of university site. While the university site is valuable in providing information for current and prospective students, this growth requires maintaining and upkeep; otherwise, accessability and efficacy declines rapidly. A three step process is used to analyze, interpret, and suggest functional improvements that can be implemented in the future.",""
